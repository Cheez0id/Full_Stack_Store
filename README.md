# Full_Stack_Store

A group project building our first full-stack application! A Full-Stack Storefront! We will design and build an app using the MVC paradigm, create your own server-side API, add user authentication, and connect to a database.

We will concieve and execute a design that solves a real-workd problem.  We will have a back end--with servers, database, APIs, and user authentication and an intuitive front end. We will continue to build on the agile development methodologies we have used throughout this course, like storing  project code in GitHub, managing work with a project management tool (Kanban), and implementing feature and bug fixes using the Git branch workflow and pull requests.
